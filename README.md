# üçù Food Retail Data Analysis 

## 1. Overview
This repository contains a notebook that serves as an introduction to data analysis for a food retail store specializing in products like pasta, pasta sauce, pancake mixes, and syrup. However, the store‚Äôs story extends beyond these offerings. Through this jupyter notebook, we aim to delve deeper into the data and extract valuable insights. You can visit our analysis via jupyter notebooks

## 2. About Data
- To effectively analyze the food retail store data, it is crucial to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset includes household-level transactions spanning two years, covering four categories: Pasta, Pasta Sauce, Syrup, and Pancake Mix.

- Please note that due to GitHub's limitations on file uploads, you will need to download the dataset from [here](https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files/). After downloading, place all the files in the data/ folder.

## 3. Objectives
- The primary goal of this notebook is to answer 7 insightful questions that will help in understanding various aspects of the store's performance and customer behavior.

## 4. Notebook Structure
- There are two notebooks located in the notebooks folder:

    1. First Notebook (`1. Trivial Information of Data.ipynb`): Contains all of the key questions. This is the notebook you need to focus on.
    2. Second Notebook (`2. Week's  Dollar Sales Forecast.ipynb`): Aimed at addressing a larger question derived from the first notebook.

- There are two main parts of these notebooks
    1. **Import Data**: In this section, we load and prepare the data that will be used throughout the analysis.
    2. **Insightful Q&A**: This section focuses on answering the 7 key questions using various analytical techniques.

## 5. Analytical Techniques

To answer the questions, the following techniques will be employed:

1. **SQL**: For querying and managing the data.
2. **Data Visualization**: To graphically represent trends and patterns.
3. **Time Series Modelling**: For analyzing and forecasting trends over time.

## 6. Acknowledgement
- We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to dunnhumby for providing the dataset. Their data has been instrumental in making this project possible.
